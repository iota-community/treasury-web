								<div class="collapse" id="question-1">
									<div class="card card-body">
										<p>The pool of IOTA tokens up for a vote in this decision originates from 2
											events:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>The initial token sale of IOTA in 2015: At the end of the year 2015,
												early participants had the chance to buy IOTA tokens before the IOTA
												Mainnet launch in 2016. They had to pay Bitcoin, Next tokens, or Jinn
												tokens to the founders, and for this, they had the right to claim an
												amount of IOTA tokens during a 90-day time frame after the Mainnet was
												launched. Some have missed this 90-day time frame for claiming. Over the
												following years, the involved parties have tried their best to find the
												remaining claimers and, by doing this, identified most of the initial
												purchasers. Despite all those attempts to find all of them, some could
												never be found again and have never claimed the tokens. The remaining
												unclaimed funds from this process are now the network's unclaimed token
												pool, which is up for a vote in this recent decision.</li>
											<li>The Kerl / Curl Bug in 2017: In 2017 a bug in the IOTA code was
												discovered, putting some users' funds at risk of being stolen. In a
												decision to protect the funds on IOTA addresses exposed to this bug, all
												IOTA Node operators voted to secure those addresses, transfer the funds
												into the custody of the IOTA Foundation, update the protocol to a
												bug-free version, and save the holders from losing their tokens. After
												this network upgrade, the owners who have been affected by this decision
												had time until 16. June 2021 to reclaim their Funds by providing proof
												of ownership in a KYC process. Some, again, have failed to reclaim their
												tokens until this date. The remaining funds from this process are now
												part of the unclaimed tokens pool, which is up for a vote in this
												current decision.</li>

								<div class="collapse" id="question-5">
									<div class="card card-body">
										<ul>
											<li><strong>If the community votes "Burn":</strong> The node operators will
												initiate a network update that removes the tokens from the ledger
												forever without any possibility of adding them again. This will reduce
												the total token supply of IOTA by around 2%.</li>
											<li><strong>If the community votes "Build":</strong> The community will
												develop a system that can guarantee decentralized governance over the
												tokens.</li>
											<p>No spending from the unclaimed token pool output happens until the
												community decides so.</p>
											<p>The node operators will only accept and agree to unlock the tokens in the
												chrysalis network and move them to a new address if the following
												requirements are met:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>There is a system of decentralized governance and ownership in
													place.</li>
												<li>The system is owned by the IOTA community and secured and managed
													using IOTA Smart Contracts (ISC).</li>
												<li>A system of decentralized decision-making about the spending of
													those tokens has been implemented.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												The community can use the Treasury website and voting system to propose
												the future governance structure and vote on those proposals.<br>
												A team of community developers will build this system for the
												community.<br>
												The system will need to be tested and fully audited before the node
												operators can move the tokens into the control of this system.<br>
												Once the system is built, activating the system will require a final
												vote by the community.<br>
												If this vote shows that the community is satisfied with the system, node
												operators will migrate the treasury tokens into an address controlled by
												the system.<br>
												From this point on, the community can use the system to spend funds from
												the treasury after successful votes on spending proposals.

										<ul>
											<li>Voting weight is a metric that reflects your potential maximum

											<li>The total voting weight is calculated from the total token balance in a
												Firefly Wallet. As 1000 IOTA tokens can generate one vote on every
												milestone of the counting period, it is calculated as (Profile balance
												in IOTA / 1000) * number of milestones defined as counting period.</li>
											<li>The current voting weight displays your already counted and confirmed

								<div class="collapse" id="question-10">
									<div class="card card-body">
										<p>
											The pre-vote period is a seven-day time frame which should guarantee that
											every voter has enough time to cast a vote before the time-based counting of
											votes starts. In these seven days, you are free to cast a vote, change a
											vote, change the number of tokens used in the vote whenever you like. The
											nodes will consider your last taken decision in the upcoming counting

											In these ten days, the nodes will count the vote you have cast during the

											counting period will add votes according to your used token balance to the
											total vote count. Counted votes are not reversible or changeable in this
