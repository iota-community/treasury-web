						<h4>Proposal announcement:</h4>
						<p>Upon publishing the vote proposal to the GitHub Repository and implementing and displaying it
							to the Treasury website, the Hornet node operators can implement the vote proposal now as an
							event in their nodes. The participating nodes are now observing the Tangle and are ready to
							count votes for this proposal.</p>
						<h4 class="top-40">Voting open (seven days):</h4>
						<p>The 'voting open" phase starts at a predefined point in time (a milestone) in the IOTA
							network. Users can now vote using the Firefly wallets voting functionality. Changes in
							voters' opinions during this timeframe can be done without influencing the final vote count
							of the voter. Voters are required to initiate the vote during these seven days to gain their
							maximum possible votes counted.</p>
						<h4 class="top-40">Counting start (10 days)</h4>
						<p>This period follows the "voting open" phase: the declared vote of a user is now counted. The
							number of counted votes will increase with every passing milestone (one milestone is issued
							every 10 seconds) in the network. If a voter did issue the vote during the "voting open"
							phase, the vote would reach the maximum possible counted votes related to the number of
							tokens used by the voter. If a voter attempts changing the selected vote option in this
							timeframe, the counting for the new option starts with the confirmation of the change in
							Firefly. Although the option has changed and new votes are now counted for a different
							option, the previously counted votes for the first option are not dismissed and count as
							valid votes. </p>

						<p>You can execute your vote in the Firefly Wallet. Once published, every user can install the
							latest update of the Firefly software, which will contain the new voting functionality.</p>
						<p>You decide which option you want to vote for and which wallet and token balance should
							participate in the vote. You can individually vote with all wallets in a profile. If you
							only want to use a part of your tokens to vote, moving this amount into a separate wallet in
							your profile is necessary. You will confirm the prepared voting transaction with your
							Stronghold password or Ledger Nano hardware wallet.</p>
						<p class="top-75 bit-larger"><strong>B) Initiate a vote directly here on the website:</strong>

						<p>This website includes a voting application. In this application, you can prepare your vote by

							wallet, where further selection and confirmation steps are required from you.

						<p class="top-75 bit-larger"><strong>Technical details of the vote:</strong></p>
						<p>The voting mechanism uses IOTA's capability to issue value transactions with attached
							metadata. In a vote, a transaction is issued that moves the tokens residing on your address
							(and specifically, the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) of this address). In this
							transaction, the sender and receiver address is identical (you are sending the tokens to
							yourself).</p>
						<p>During this transaction, the vote metadata (vote event ID, voter opinion ID: build or burn)
							will be attached and immutably written onto the UTXOs of your address in the IOTA Tangle.
							After the vote, the tokens will still reside on the same address as before, but now with
							attached information in the metadata that represents your opinion in the vote.</p>
						<p>An external security audit provider has audited this functionality. </p>

						<h4>Votes get counted in the Hornet nodes.</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Node operators can activate the participation plugin in the Hornet node software in
								every Hornet node. Nodes that initiate this plugin during the proposal announcement
								phase can produce the results because they will observe all IOTA addresses during the
								whole period and count all votes that happen.</li>
							<li>This plugin has gone through a community test and is fully audited by an external
								security audit provider.</li>
							<li>As every node in the IOTA network knows the status of every UTXO in the Tangle, they can
								observe and register changes to these UTXOs. As soon as a vote transaction is issued and
								confirmed, the UTXO contains attached metadata information. Hornet nodes that have the
								participation plugin activated will observe the ledger for UTXOs that hold this specific
								metadata (the vote event ID). They will log all UTXOs with this metadata for every new
								milestone in the Tangle and create a database of the counted votes. This node database
								will store the following information for every milestone:
								<ul style="margin: 30px 0;">
									<li>UTXO's that contain the event ID of the vote.</li>
									<li>Voter opinion ID written to this UTXO.</li>
									<li>Number of tokens residing on the UTXO.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>The plugin keeps track of all those UTXOs and adds new ones as soon as they appear in the ledger or stops further counting them as soon as they disappear. This [Github repo](hornet/participation.go at develop · gohornet/hornet (github.com)) contains the exact structure of the counting mechanism.</li>
							<li>Counting happens from the defined "counting start – milestone" till the defined "counting stop – milestone." as defined in the <i>[specification](treasury/hornet-participation-plugin.md at main · iota-community/treasury (github.com))</i></li>
							<li>As a new milestone is issued every 10 seconds, it produces an exact counting as every change in opinions or balances will be recognized in a 10-second time frame.</li>
							<li>After the defined "stop counting – milestone," the plugin produces an output with all observed UTXOs, balances, indexation payloads per milestone, and the final result as an accumulation of that milestone data. That information will also be available live during the vote via an API endpoint in every node and displayed here on the website and in your Firefly wallet.</li>
							<li>The result will be produced and verified in a decentralized fashion through every node participating in the counting. At the beginning of the counting period, the respective number of votes is counted for every milestone in which tokens containing attached voting metadata reside on a UTXO.</li>

						<p>The community has decided that 1000 IOTA (0,001 Mi) generate 1 vote every 10 seconds (with every new appearing milestone) in the counting period.</p>
						<p>So a vote of 1 Mi for "build" will be counted like this: 1000 votes counted for build on milestone x + 1000 votes counted for build on milestone y, + 1000 votes counted for build on milestone y... This method would produce during a counting period of 1500 milestones the following vote count:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>1500 milestones x 1000 votes per milestone = 1,5 million votes counted for opinion build.</strong></li>
							</ul>

						<p>All nodes will count all UTXO with attached voting metadata they observe during the "counting
							phase" of the vote and add up the votes for every milestone until the counting phase ends
							(marked by a predefined ending milestone).</p>
						<p>This counting mechanism also leads to the fact that the "vote holding time" for tokens will
							greatly influence the result. Votes gain "weight" in relation to how long they are kept on
							an address. This is a crucial security feature of the voting mechanism that will reward long
							term token holders and punish voting "speculators" or "vote buyers" by forcing them to lock
							capital over a longer time period and making an attempt to "buy votes" a speculative risk
							due to the potential IOTA price volatility in the ten days counting period.</p>

						<p class="bit-larger"><strong>Let's look at a few examples of the possible vote count based on
								different variables:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>If the counting phase of a vote is ten days and a user has a balance of 100 Miota (Mi)
								in their Firefly wallet, which is used to vote:</li>
							<li>Holding the tokens for the entire ten days of the required counting phase will give the
								voter 100% of the possible vote counts.</li>
							<li>Holding the tokens for only seven consecutive days of 10 full days would reach only 70%
								of the maximum possible vote counts. Executing a vote after the counting phase has
								already started (for example, on day two of 10 days total) and not changing the vote
								until the end of the counting phase the voter would gain 80% of the possible vote count
								of the 100 Mi.</li>
							<li>
								Starting the vote at the beginning of the counting phase with "Burn," keeping this
								opinion for three days and then changing to "Build," holding it for the remaining seven
								days would result in the following outcome:
								<div class="top-20">100 Mi vote three days for "Burn": 30% of the user's maximum
									achievable votes are counted for "Burn." Now, changing the vote, for the remaining
									seven days, 100 Mi vote for "Build": the remaining 70% of the user's available votes
									are counted for "Build"</div>

						<p>The community validates the results of this voting process. Once the defined time window of
							the vote has passed (7days pre-vote + 10 days counting period), all Hornet node operators
							who participated in the counting of the proposal can publish their counting result in a
							public Github repository. The result will be published as a hash checksum of the counting
							database file for easy comparing. Everyone is invited to check and validate the submitted
							count results to ensure no differences exist.</p>
						<p><strong>Community-defined voting rules.</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>It has been defined that 100% of all valid IOTA votes are the total amount of IOTA
								tokens successfully migrated into the Chrysalis network at the milestone "holding period
								end."</li>
							<li>A minimum total participation is not required to create a legitimate and binding vote
								outcome. Only the number of valid votes issued and counted during the defined entire
								voting period will determine the result.</li>
							<li>The winner will be the option that receives the simple majority of 50% plus one of all
								valid counted votes.</li>
							<li>Should an error in the code of the voting mechanism in Firefly or the counting mechanism
								in Hornet be discovered, or the voting system was proven to have been compromised, the
								result will be deemed invalid.</li>
							<li>In this case, the vote will need to be repeated. This new vote can only occur once the
								bug or vulnerability has been eliminated and a new security audit is completed.</li>
							<li>Should the outcome of the vote be a draw, the community will set up a second vote with
								the same conditions as the first one.</li>
