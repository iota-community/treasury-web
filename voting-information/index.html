After so many years of waiting, the final deadline for claims had to be made on or before June 16th 2021.</p><p>It is now up to the community to decide how to utilize these unclaimed funds.</p><p>On the day the Chrysalis upgrade took place Node Operators had two options:</p><ul><li>[ ] Follow a version of the network where those funds are still under the unpredictable control of a single actor <strong>(IOTA AS Fork)</strong></li><li>[ ] Give the community the chance to decide the future use of those funds. <strong>(IOTA Chrysalis Mainnet)</strong>.</li></ul><p>None of the Node operators or users came forward in support of the IOTA AS Network.****</p><p>This is a clear decision by the IOTA community that they want to go the way to decide the further destiny of the tokens with two options to choose from: Build vs Treasury. Other options were not part of the original two choices because they can occur later.</p><p>A detail explanation about the above described topics can be found in the following Blog Posts published by the IOTA Foundation:</p><p><a href="https://blog.iota.org/unclaimed-tokens-community-treasury-and-iota-as-faq/">https://blog.iota.org/unclaimed-tokens-community-treasury-and-iota-as-faq/</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.iota.org/iota-community-treasury-and-genesis-validation/">https://blog.iota.org/iota-community-treasury-and-genesis-validation/</a></p><p>Shortly after the Chrysalis update and those Blog Posts, a Governance channel was established in the IOTA Discord Server where the IOTA Community began to discuss this topic intensively.</p><p>Since then, many members have been actively involved in developing a solution to give the whole IOTA community a voice and make a vote possible.</p><p>It is important to mention that this is a purely community-driven initiative, and the IOTA Foundation is not actively leading those discussions. The IOTA Foundation has offered support in technical questions and administration and will always support community-driven initiatives.</p><h3><strong>The following resources have been created since then</strong></h3><ul><li><p>[ ] <strong>Github Repository</strong> - here the community started a more focussed discussion on topics initially and contains a documentation of the whole process:<br><a href="https://github.com/iota-community/Community-Governance/discussions">https://github.com/iota-community/Community-Governance/discussions</a><br>A second repository focussing on the specifications of the tech and the real software development is this one:<br><a href="https://github.com/iota-community/treasury">https://github.com/iota-community/treasury</a></p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>IOTA Discord Channels:</strong><br>The community created discussion channels where daily ongoing discussions about the topics take place.

Only holding it on that address for the full defined voting time builds 100% voting weight.</p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>100% of all valid votes</strong> is defined as the amount of IOTA tokens successfully migrated into the chrysalis network at the milestone when the vote-counting period ends.**</p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>Minimum total participation</strong> is not required to create a legit and binding vote outcome - only the amount of valid votes cast will be used to determine the result.</p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>The winner</strong> will be the option that receives the simple majority of 50% plus 1 of all valid votes.</p></li><li><p>[ ] Should an <strong>error in the code</strong> be discovered during or after a voting decision or the voting system has been proven to have been compromised or exploited the vote will be deemed invalid.</p></li><li><p>[ ] In this case the vote will need to be repeated. This vote can only take place once the bug or vulnerability has been eliminated and a security audit has been successfully completed.</p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>Should the outcome of the vote be a draw</strong>, the community will set up a second vote with the same conditions as the first one.</p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>The vote will be initiated on the Treasury Website and executed in the Firefly Wallet</strong> via a system developed by the community with technical support by the IF.</p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>Counting will happen in a Hornet node plugin</strong>. Node owners will be able to implement this plugin and validate the voting process.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>What will happen after the decision takes place?</strong></h2><ul><li><p>If the community votes BURN:</p><ul><li>Nothing more will happen. The IOTA Node operators will continue to use the current snapshot file that eliminates the tokens from the Network. As the IOTA community has agreed and voted on, the Tokens will stay unmigrated forever.</li></ul></li><li><p>If the community votes BUILD:</p><ul><li>The community will need to build a system that can guarantee decentralized governance over the Tokens.</li><li>No spending from the Treasury pool can happen untill this system has been created by the community.</li><li>The node operators will only accept and agree to migrate the tokens into the Network on an <em>address</em> that meets the following requirements:</li></ul></li></ul><ol><li>There is a system of governance in place.</li><li>The system is distributed.</li><li>It is decentralised.</li><li>It is owned by the IOTA Community and secured and managed using IOTA smart contracts (ISCP).</li></ol><ul><li>The community can use this Treasury Website and voting system to propose how the future governance structure should look like and vote on those proposals.</li><li>A Team of developers will need to build this system for the community.</li><li>The system will need to be tested and fully audited before the Tokens can be moved into the control of this system.</li><li>Once the system is built, a final vote by the community will be required to agree to activate the system.</li><li>If this vote shows that the community is satisfied with the system, node operators will migrate the Treasury Tokens into an address that is controlled by the system.</li><li>From this point on the system can be used by the community to spend funds from the treasury.</li></ul><h2><strong>The Voting mechanism:</strong></h2><p>IOTA holders will receive an updated version of the Firefly Wallet with integrated voting functionality.<br>Votes are related to the balance of a user. 100 Mi = 100 million votes.</p><h3><strong>The Vote will be separated into different phases</strong></h3><ul><li><p>[ ] <strong>Commencing:</strong> The timeframe where users are invited to cast a vote and are free to change their vote at any time without consequence.<br>The duration of the voting period should be long enough to provide community members a suitable amount of time to review and evaluate voting information needed to make an informed decision.</p><ul><li>Commencing period start on xx.xx.21 at xx:xx UTC and ends with the start of the holding period on xx.xx.21 at xx:xx UTC</li></ul></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>Holding:</strong> The timeframe in which votes need to be held on addresses to reach their total weight.<br>-Tokens can be moved,however this action will mean those moved Votes/Tokens will no longer be counted.They also can't be used to vote again on this same referendum.<br>-The percentage of building voting weight is directly proportional to holding time.<br>-Only votes kept from the beginning till the end of the holding period reach their total voting weight.</p><ul><li>Holding period start on xx.xx.21 at xx:xx UTC and ends on xx.xx.21 at xx:xx UTC - holding period is exact X days.</li></ul></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>Ending:</strong> Once the pre-defined End vote milestone has been reached, this will mark the end of the voting period. At this point the votes will be counted by a software plugin and the vote outcome will be published.</p></li><li><p>[ ] This software will be implemented in the Hornet nodes, and every node owner can activate this and validate the count with their own node.</p></li></ul><h3>This is the proposed Voting flow for a user:</h3><ul><li>new flowchart will come soon</li></ul><h3>This is how a user will cast a valid vote:</h3><ul><li><p>[ ] Users will be able to connect from the Treasury Website to their Firefly Wallet. Deep link functionality will be executed in Firefly. All relevant settings for the vote execution can be done on the Website.</p></li><li><p>[ ] The Website itself will have no direct access to the Firefly Wallets Security Functions. To access Firefly, the Extension <strong>GLOW</strong> is used. It is only a tool that creates the exact transaction logic and transfers this info to Firefly using the deep link function. The Website will establish a connection to the Firefly Wallet using <strong>GLOW</strong>. The Glow extension will collect the following information from Firefly after authorization through the user:</p><ul><li>Profile name</li><li>Total profile balance</li><li>Names of individual Wallets</li><li>Balances of individual Wallets</li></ul></li><li><p>[ ] Nothing of this Information will be stored on the Website or in any Database. Read the security Audit regarding the Functionality of <strong>GLOW</strong> and the Treasury Website here:</p><ul><li>Link...</li></ul></li><li><p>[ ] You will decide which option you want to choose, and then you will be able to decide which amount of Votes (derived from token balance) should be used in the vote (you can click/unclick all Wallets of the Profile). If you want to use only a part of your tokens, it is recommended to collect them in a separate Wallet of your Profile.</p></li><li><p>[ ] Now your Firefly Wallet opens, and you are asked to unlock the vote in Firefly with your Stronghold password and confirm the decision.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Firefly initiates the following logic:</strong></p><ul><li><p>[ ] Every involved address sends a transaction that inherits the amount of Votes = IOTA Tokens chosen by the Voter to itself. If the wallet contains several addresses, the amount will be selected from those addresses to match. Addresses send tokens to themselves.</p></li><li><p>[ ] As an indexation Payload of these Transactions, the opinion (Burn / Build) will be attached as Data in the message payload</p></li><li><p>[ ] With this system, you are always in control of the funds. All IOTA Tokens will stay in your wallet and are not moved out of your control.</p></li><li><p>-If you hold tokens over the entire defined timeframe on the addresses, the vote weight counts in full. Should you decide to move the tokens earlier, they will not carry their full weight potential.<br>-The time the tokens have been used to vote will be applied as a percentage of their total voting power (7 days holding of 10 days total holding period will count 70%).</p></li></ul><h3>Detailed current specification here:</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/iota-community/treasury/blob/main/specifications/chrysalis-referendum-rfc.md">https://github.com/iota-community/treasury/blob/main/specifications/chrysalis-referendum-rfc.md</a></p><h3>This is how you can change a vote:</h3><ul><li><p>[ ] <strong>During commencing period:</strong> Open the voting menu on the Website and initiate a new vote as described above. The old vote will be removed and the new one initiated.</p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>During the holding period:</strong> Initiating a standard transaction with tokens that are currently used to vote will remove the Indexation Data payload together with the tokens from the UTXO.</p></li><li><p>[ ] The hornet plugin will recognize this change with the next milestone and stop accumulating the votes for this address.</p></li><li><p>[ ] To use a different amount of votes now, you have to initiate a new vote as described above.</p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>During the holding period:</strong><br>You can always add tokens into the vote that are not currently used by initiating the voting process for those Wallets.</p></li><li><p>[ ] The tokens will then be counted from the next milestone on and will also reach a percentage of the total weight (starting on day 7 of 10 will create only 30% total voting power for those tokens)</p></li><li><p>[ ] <strong>Changing the opinion:</strong><br>-You can also change the opinion of the vote during the holding period. Therefore the process can be initiated to “change opinion,” and the tokens will be sent again, but now with the opposite opinion in the Data payload. From the next milestone on, the Votes will accumulate weight for the new opinion, but the opinion weight that has been collected until the change has happened will still count for the first opinion. So if you changed the opinion exactly at “halftime” of the vote with an unchanged token amount, both opinions would accumulate exactly 50% weight and therefore result in an effective 0 - sum vote count at the end of the holding time.</p></li></ul><h3>Using Github to create, discuss, approve and publish proposals</h3><p>Text .....</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/131207054-a6d488f1-ccce-46c2-8e2c-dd7c8576f404.png" alt="Github proposal"></p><h3>This is how votes will be counted:</h3><ul><li><p>[ ] <strong>A plugin/extension of the Hornet Node Software</strong> can be activated in every hornet node.
